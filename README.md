# AIMEX - Fully 2PC Colorbot

## An Advanced, Undetectable Two-Computer Colorbot System for Valorant

AIMEX is a fully external colorbot designed for competitive gaming. This system operates on a unique two-computer architecture, leveraging NDI video streaming and a specialized hardware interface (MAKCU) to ensure undetectability. It provides real-time responsiveness (~60 FPS) and offer configuration via a web-based user interface accessible from anywhere on your local network.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Two-PC Architecture:** Isolates the botting logic on a secondary machine, significantly reducing the risk of detection.
* **NDI Video Integration:** Utilizes OBS-NDI for high-performance, low-latency video streaming of game frames over your local network.
* **Advanced Color Filtering:** Employs OpenCV for robust HSV-based color range filtering to precisely identify target areas
* **Precision Targeting:** Identifies the highest visible point of the filtered color to accurately estimate enemy head positions
* **Undetectable Input Injection (MAKCU):** Integrates with a MAKCU device to merge calculated mouse movements with legitimate user inputs, bypassing typical anti-cheat mechanisms by maintaining the original mouse HID.
* **Real-time Performance:** Engineered for high responsiveness and low latency, operating effectively at approximately 60 frames per second with minimal performance overhead.
* **Web-based Configuration:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for configuration from any device on your network.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The AIMEX system orchestrates a series of steps across two distinct computers to achieve its functionality:

1.  **Game Capture (Main PC):** OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) captures the `game.exe` window on your primary gaming computer.
2.  **NDI Video Stream (Main PC to Second PC):** The captured game video is then streamed over your local area network (LAN) to the second computer using the **OBS-NDI** plugin. 
3.  **Video Frame Reception (Second PC):** The second computer, running the application, receives these NDI video frames via the `ndi_receiver.cpp` module.
4.  **Color Filtering & Target Identification (Second PC):**
    * The received video frame is processed through `color_filter.cpp`. It converts the frame to HSV color space.
    * A similarity map is generated by filtering for a user-defined color range, effectively highlighting enemies.
    * To pinpoint the estimated head position, the system searches this similarity map for the topmost pixel of the target color and applies a vertical offset.
5.  **Mouse Movement Calculation (Second PC):**
    * The `vector_calculator.cpp` module determines the pixel distance and direction required to move the player's crosshair (center of the frame) to the identified enemy head position.
    * This pixel distance is converted into a `mouse.move` value using the following formula:
        $$ 1.07437623 \times \text{Sensitivity}^{-0.9936827126} $$
6.  **Input Injection (MAKCU Device):**
    * The calculated mouse movement values are sent from the second PC to the MAKCU device connected to the **main gaming PC**.
    * The `usb_sender.cpp` module handles communication with the MAKCU device via the `makcu.h/.cpp` interface.
    * The MAKCU device then physically adds these movement commands to the user's existing mouse inputs. Because it operates at a hardware level and maintains the original mouse's Human Interface Device (HID), this method makes the system difficult for anti-cheat software to detect.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

* **Main Gaming Computer:** Capable of running both the game (e.g., Valorant) and OBS simultaneously with sufficient performance.
* **Second Computer:** Runs the AIMEX colorbot system. Tested and confirmed to work efficiently on a **Raspberry Pi 4B**.
* **MAKCU Device:** Essential for hardware-level mouse input injection. While other devices *might* work, official support is only for MAKCU.
* **Ethernet Connection:** A stable, wired Ethernet connection between the main PC and the second PC is crucial for maintaining low-latency video streaming via NDI.

### Software Requirements

* **C++ 17:** The modern C++ standard used throughout the project.
* **Boost Libraries:** General-purpose C++ libraries, used for various utilities.
* **OpenCV:** Computer Vision Library for all image processing and analysis tasks.
* **NDI SDK:** NewTek's Network Device Interface Software Development Kit, necessary for NDI video reception.
* **httplib:** A lightweight C++ HTTP server and client library, used for the web-based configuration UI.
* **nlohmann_json:** A header-only C++ JSON library for parsing and serialization, used for configuration management via the web UI.

## üöÄ Build Instructions (Windows)

Follow these steps to build the AIMEX project on a Windows environment.

1.  **Install vcpkg packages:**
    * If you haven't already, install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) and bootstrap it following their official instructions.
    * Install the required dependencies using vcpkg:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install opencv boost nlohmann-json httplib libusb
        ```

2.  **Install NDI SDK:**
    * Download and install the NDI SDK from the official NewTek website: [https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/](https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/)
    * **Crucially**, ensure that the NDI SDK is installed to the default path: `C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 6 SDK`. If you install it elsewhere, you will need to adjust the `NDI_SDK_PATH` in the CMake command below.

3.  **Generate the build files using CMake:**
    * Navigate to your project's build directory (e.g., create a `.build/` folder in the root of your project and `cd` into it).
    * Run the following CMake command:
        ```bash
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -DNDI_SDK_PATH="C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 6 SDK"
        ```

4.  **Build the project:**
    * After CMake successfully configures the build system, compile the project using:
        ```bash
        cmake --build .
        ```

5.  **Run the executable:**
    * The compiled executable (`AIMEX.exe`) will be located in your build directory, under `Release/`.
    * **Important:** When running the program, ensure that all required DLL files (from OpenCV, Boost, NDI, etc., which might be in your vcpkg installation's `bin` folder) and the `web/` folder (containing the web UI static files) are located in the **same directory as the executable**.
    * To configure the program, access the web UI from any browser on your network by navigating to `http://<IP_OF_SECOND_PC>:<WEB_PORT>` (default port is `8080`).
