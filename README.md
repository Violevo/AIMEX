# AIMEX - Fully 2PC Colorbot

## A fast, fully external colorbot for competitive gaiming
> üöß **Disclaimer:**
> AIMEX is in **VERY** early beta ‚Äî expect bugs, missing functionality, and broken features.

AIMEX is a high-performance colorbot designed for competitive gaming, operating solely on a second computer to ensure complete isolation from the game's anti-cheat system. It uses NDI video streaming and a hardware input device (MAKCU or alternative) to interface with the main computer without ever needing to run any code on it. The system requires minimal performance overhead, allowing it to run on low-end hardware such as a Raspberry Pi 4B or an old laptop with good performance. Configuration is done through a modern web interface, which can be accessed from any device on the user‚Äôs local network.

## üé• System Overview

1.  **Game Capture (Main PC):** OBS captures the `game.exe` window on your primary gaming computer.
2.  **NDI Video Stream (Main PC to Second PC):** The captured game video is then streamed over your local area network (LAN) to the second computer using the **OBS-NDI** plugin. 
3.  **Video Frame Reception (Second PC):** The second computer, running the application, receives these NDI video frames via the `ndi_receiver.cpp` module.
4.  **Color Filtering & Target Identification (Second PC):**
    * The received video frame is processed through `color_filter.cpp`. It converts the frame to HSV color space.
    * A similarity map is generated by filtering for a user-defined color range, effectively highlighting enemies.
    * To pinpoint the estimated head position, the system searches this similarity map for the topmost pixel of the target color.
5.  **Mouse Movement Calculation (Second PC):**
    * The `vector_calculator.cpp` module determines the pixel distance and direction required to move the player's crosshair (center of the frame) to the identified enemy head position.
    * This pixel vector is normalized (magnitude is limited), this is effectivley just a bad version of smoothing.
6.  **Input Injection (MAKCU Device):**
    * The calculated mouse movement values are sent from the second PC to the MAKCU device connected to the **main gaming PC**.
    * The `usb_sender.cpp` module handles communication with the MAKCU device via the `makcu.h/.cpp` interface.
    * The MAKCU device then physically adds these movement commands to the user's existing mouse inputs. Because it operates at a hardware level and maintains the original mouse's Human Interface Device (HID), this method makes the system difficult for anti-cheat software to detect.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

* **Main Gaming Computer:** Capable of running both the game (e.g., Valorant) and OBS simultaneously with sufficient performance.
* **Second Computer:** Runs the AIMEX colorbot system. Tested and confirmed to work efficiently on a **Raspberry Pi 4B**.
* **MAKCU Device:** Essential for hardware-level mouse input injection. While other devices *might* work, official support is only for MAKCU.
* **Ethernet Connection:** A stable, wired Ethernet connection between the main PC and the second PC is crucial for maintaining low-latency video streaming via NDI.

### Software Requirements

* **C++ 17:** The modern C++ standard used throughout the project.
* **Boost Libraries:** General-purpose C++ libraries, used for various utilities.
* **OpenCV:** Computer Vision Library for all image processing and analysis tasks.
* **NDI SDK:** NewTek's Network Device Interface Software Development Kit, necessary for NDI video reception.
* **httplib:** A lightweight C++ HTTP server and client library, used for the web-based configuration UI.
* **nlohmann_json:** A header-only C++ JSON library for parsing and serialization, used for configuration management via the web UI.

## üöÄ Build Instructions (Windows)

Follow these steps to build the AIMEX project on a Windows environment.

1.  **Install vcpkg packages:**
    * If you haven't already, install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) and bootstrap it following their official instructions.
    * Install the required dependencies using vcpkg:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install opencv boost nlohmann-json httplib libusb
        ```

2.  **Install NDI SDK:**
    * Download and install the NDI SDK from the official NewTek website: [https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/](https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/)
    * **Crucially**, ensure that the NDI SDK is installed to the default path: `C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 6 SDK`. If you install it elsewhere, you will need to adjust the `NDI_SDK_PATH` in the CMake command below.

3.  **Generate the build files using CMake:**
    * Navigate to your project's build directory (e.g., create a `.build/` folder in the root of your project and `cd` into it).
    * Run the following CMake command:
        ```bash
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -DNDI_SDK_PATH="C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 6 SDK"
        ```

4.  **Build the project:**
    * After CMake successfully configures the build system, compile the project using:
        ```bash
        cmake --build .
        ```

5.  **Run the executable:**
    * The compiled executable (`AIMEX.exe`) will be located in your build directory, under `Release/`.
    * **Important:** When running the program, ensure that all required DLL files (from OpenCV, Boost, NDI, etc., which might be in your vcpkg installation's `bin` folder) and the `web/` folder (containing the web UI static files) are located in the **same directory as the executable**.
    * To configure the program, access the web UI from any browser on your network by navigating to `http://<IP_OF_SECOND_PC>:<WEB_PORT>` (default port is `8080`).
